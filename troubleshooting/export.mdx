| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Table wraps poorly in PDF    | Keep tables narrow; split wide tables into two smaller ones.       |
| Images look soft or cropped  | Use higher resolution images; keep aspect ratio; avoid huge files. |
| Heading levels lost in DOCX  | Re-apply **H2/H3** to section titles, then re-export.              |
| Bullets/numbering misaligned | Convert nested lists to two simple lists; avoid over-nesting.      |

<Tip>
  If one format looks off, try the other (DOCX ↔ PDF) for submission.
