### Add while writing

1. Place the cursor at the end of the sentence, and the following suggestion may include a citation.
2. Search by topic/keywords and select a source.
3. The in-text citation is inserted; the entry appears in **References**.

### Filter & refine

- Use **year** filters (e.g., after 2020).
- Preview the source before inserting.

### Multiple citations in one sentence

- Repeat **Cite** to add another source to the same sentence.
- SparkDoc formats the in-text citation accordingly.

### Edit a citation

- Click the in-text citation and select **edit**.
- Adjust fields (e.g., page, access date) and update.

**Tip:** Add citations as you go to avoid end-of-paper cleanup.
