## 1) Create your first document

1. Click **Start New \+**.
2. Select outline style choice, if desired.
3. Enter document prompt.
4. Give your draft a clear title (you can rename anytime at the top).

## 2) Choose an outline mode

| Mode           | What you get                                                                  | When to use                                             |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Creative**   | Custom section headings based on your **Document Prompt** \+ **Tone**         | You want a tailored structure to your topic             |
| **Standard**   | Classic academic sections (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, …) | You want a familiar template fast                       |
| **No outline** | Blank page                                                                    | You want to free-write, then **generate outline** later |

## 3) Write a document prompt & set the tone

- **Document Prompt**: Describe your topic and scope.\
  _Example:_ “How sleep duration affects learning outcomes in undergraduates (focus on GPA \+ attention).”
- **Tone**: **Academic**, **Professional**, **Casual**, or **Semi-formal**.

**Tip:** You can change **Tone** later and use **Reword** on selected text.

## 4) Draft your first paragraph

1. Place the cursor under the first heading and start typing.
2. Use **Autocomplete** (press **Cmd/Ctrl \+ /**) for a first pass; **Enter/Insert** to accept, **Begin typing** to dismiss.
3. Highlight any sentence → **Use AI** to clarify, condense, translate, expand, or reword.

**Next step:** Add citations as you write (see **Citations & References**).
