<Tip>
  Write clear section headings first; better structure â†’ better suggestions.
</Tip>

### How it works

- Keep typing naturally; suggestions appear inline.
- **Enter/Insert** to accept, **Esc** to dismiss, or simply keep typing.
- Use **Cmd/Ctrl /** to trigger on demand.
- **Retry** to see another option.

### Best practices

- Combine with **Use AI** to clarify or shift tone post-accept.
- If a suggestion cites a source, it will sync with **References**.

### Troubleshooting

- No suggestion? Type a few more words or trigger with **Cmd/Ctrl /**.
- Off-topic suggestion? Retry, or adjust the surrounding sentence for context.
