### Create a share link

1. Click **Share Document** in the footer.
2. Copy the link and send it to collaborators.

### What viewers can do

- Read the document (view-only).
- Copy text for comments elsewhere.
- They **cannot** edit your original.

### Best practices

- Add context in your message (what feedback you want).
- Revoke the link by toggling **Share** off (if supported in your workspace).
- When sharing drafts, keep sensitive data out or pseudonymize.

**Note:** For formal submissions, use **Export** (DOCX or PDF).
