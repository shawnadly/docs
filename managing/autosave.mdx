### How it works

- Changes save in the background as you type.
- A temporary connection issue will retry automatically.

### Best practices

- Give your document a clear title right away.
- Avoid closing the tab while uploads (images, large tables) are processing.

**Note:** Use **Share** for read-only review links; recipients wonâ€™t affect your autosave.
